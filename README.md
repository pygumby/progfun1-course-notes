**Notes on and source code from the Coursera course "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" by Martin Odersky**

---

* The contents of this repository are based on the Coursera course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://de.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) by Martin Odersky ([@odersky](https://github.com/odersky), [lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky)).
  This repository only represents a fraction of what is to be found within the course.
  Also, this repository contains many additions and comments that are not part of the course.
